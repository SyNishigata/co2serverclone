Database Notes:

  - Majority of the important pieces of data is stored in the table: wp_posts

  - In wp_posts, sort by post_type to help you find specific pieces of data (ex. pages)

  - Planted trees, emissions, and other forms can be found in wp_posts

  - To see the specific attributes of a form, for example planted trees, look under wp_posts and 
      find the row that matches that specific tree (for help with finding that row, possibly look 
      under post_modified if you recently entered/modified a tree, it will show when that tree was 
      last changed).  Once you found the row for the tree in question, look for its ID.  Now go into
      the wp_postmeta table and sort by post_id and find the ID from the tree in question.  You will
      now see all the attributes for that tree, such as treeUnit, treeDiameter, etc. 

  - Note that the above method works for all post types
